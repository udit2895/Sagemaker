# Mobile Price Range Classification using Random Forest Classifier

This project demonstrates the process of building and deploying a machine learning model for a mobile price range classification problem using Amazon SageMaker. The project utilizes the Mobile Price Range dataset and is set up in the VSCode environment.

## Steps

### 1. Machine Learning Classification Problem

This project tackles a machine learning classification problem using the Amazon SageMaker service.

### 2. Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the Mobile Price Range dataset, which contains information about various mobile phones and their price ranges.

### 3. VSCode Environment Setup

Ensure that you have set up your development environment using Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

### 4. AWS S3 Bucket Creation

Create an S3 bucket in Amazon Web Services (AWS) to store the data and model artifacts.

### 5. Connecting to S3 Bucket using Boto3

Utilize the Boto3 library to establish a connection to the AWS S3 bucket, enabling data storage and retrieval.

### 6. SageMaker Session Creation

Create a SageMaker session to interact with SageMaker services, facilitating model training and deployment.

### 7. Random Forest Classifier

Build a machine learning model for classification using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm.

### 8. Creating SKLearn Estimator

Utilize script.py as the entry point and create an SKLearn estimator for training the machine learning model.

### 9. Training and Deployment

Train the model using the created estimator and deploy the trained model for real-time predictions.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Set up your VSCode environment.
3. Create an S3 bucket on AWS.
4. Update the necessary configurations in script.py.
5. Execute the steps in the provided Jupyter notebook or script for model training and deployment.
